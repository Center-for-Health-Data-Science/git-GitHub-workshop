## git-GitHub-workshop-2022

This repository is used for the HeaDS git and GitHub workshop 2022.
Workshop participants should clone the repo after which they can use it to complete workshop exercises associated. The shared repo is made for hosting cooking recipies which are made locally by participents and then pushed to remote for everyone to view.
